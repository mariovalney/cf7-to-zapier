== Description ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Did you renamed the plugin? =

Yes. Due to [this](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/08/08/trademark-enforcement/).

= Does it works with Gutenberg? =

Yes. We support WordPress 5+ and CF7 too.

= Does it works for forms sent out of CF7? =

Nope. The intention here is to integrate CF7 to Zapier (and another webhooks).

= Can I use it without Zapier? =

Yep. We are creating a integration to Zapier webhook, but you can insert any URL to receive a JSON formated data.

= My sent data is empty =

Please, go to [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cf7-to-zapier/) to get help.

= Who are the developers? =

[MÃ¡rio Valney](https://mariovalney.com/me)

Brazilian developer who is part of [WordPress community](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mariovalney).

= How can I show webhook errors on form submit? =

We already show WordPress request errors. If you want to add theatment to webhook errors, please [check this post](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/form-sent-to-zapier-randomly/#post-11249864).

= How can I upload files and send link to webhook? =

If you send a form with file, we will copy this to a directory before CF7 remove it and send the link to Zapier.

= How can I rename a field to webhook? =

You can add a "webhook" option to your field on form edit tab.

It's like the "class" option: `[text your-field class:form-control id:field-id webhook:webhook-key]`.

This will create a text field with name "your-field", class "form-control", id "field-id" and will be sent to webhook with key "webhook-key".

= How I can get the free text value? =

We will replace the value for last option (which is the free_text input) with the value.

This way your webhook will receive the free text value and other options if you allow it (like in checkbox).

= Can I help you? =

Yes! Visit [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mariovalney/cf7-to-zapier).
